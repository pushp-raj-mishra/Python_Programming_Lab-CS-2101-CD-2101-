# Experiment 2: Task 4: Create a complex, nested dictionary representing IIIT Ranchiâ€™s organizational structure.
# (Visit:https://iiitranchi.ac.in/organizational_structure.aspx).
# Write a Python program that accepts the name of an Assistant Professor and iterates through the dictionary to search for that professor. 
# If the name is found, print the department they belong to. 
# If the name is not found at the current level, continue to the next level of the dictionary. 
# If the name is not found in the entire structure, display a message indicating that the Assistant Professor was not found.
